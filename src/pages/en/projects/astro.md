This resume website, which I made with Astro, demonstrates my front-end development abilities. In addition to giving companies and recruiters instant access to details about my background, it also conveniently showcases my work with contemporary frameworks because of its responsive design and multilingual support.

Tailwind CSS and Shadcn were used to implement the styling, while Astro was utilized to create a quick and optimized website. I used TypeScript and React for dynamic components, which improves the code's dependability.

The project's primary objectives were to display my project portfolio in an approachable manner and to produce an interactive resume website that showcases my web development abilities. I was able to experiment developing a responsive and bilingual interface and making the site load quickly thanks to the project.

I worked on every phase of the development process, from design and planning to coding and optimization. I used Astro to fully implement the frontend, configured the styles, used TypeScript and React to create dynamic components, and made sure the website was responsive and multilingual.

The project's main characteristics include multilingual support, a mobile-friendly design, an interactive portfolio, and contemporary styling. The optimization guarantees quick loading and simple navigation, while the dynamic components enhance code security.

I gained a lot of knowledge and proficiency using Astro as a potent tool for creating quick websites during this project. Although this is my first website created using Astro, it won't be my last because I am sure of the technology's potential and intend to use it in other projects in the future.
