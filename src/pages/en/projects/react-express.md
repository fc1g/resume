This project is a website created to highlight a rental home in Spain, with an emphasis on prospective tenants searching for a cozy place to reside. The website's responsive and contemporary design improves user experience.

I decided to utilize React for the front end because it enables a dynamic display of the house's details, including pictures, descriptions, and other important information. Express.js powers the back end, which is in charge of managing property data and responding to requests. A MongoDB database contains all of the house's and reservations' information. I used Tailwind CSS to style the interface, giving it a neat and fashionable appearance.

The project's primary objective is to streamline the rental home booking process and provide consumers with all the information they need to make wise choices. As the project's lead developer, I was in charge of integrating the front-end and back-end components and putting them into practice. I also developed the site's design components

One of the project's main features is a friendly home page with a picture of the house and Facebook reviews that emphasize the advantages of staying here. The "About Us" website features an interactive slider with pictures of the property and tabs with details on the house, its surroundings, rental terms, and ways to get around.

Local points of interest are displayed on the "Surroundings" page, which also offers pagination, filtering, sorting, and display number limitation options. Every place of interest has its own page with a map indicating its location in relation to the home, a photo, and a description. For every site, links to Google Maps-generated routes are also supplied.

A pricing structure and a calendar showing reserved dates are both included on the "Contact" tab. A summary of the terms of the reservation and important details for tenants are given below that. For individuals who need help, there is also an accordion with the owner's and their assistant's contact information.

All things considered, this project successfully streamlines the Spanish home leasing process by giving prospective tenants easily comprehensible information. The website greatly improves the user experience with features like thorough property descriptions and nearby attractions. The platform serves the demands of both renters and property owners by leveraging contemporary technologies like React, Express.js, and MongoDB, making it an invaluable tool for tourists looking for a comfortable stay.
